      <h2>FAQ.</h2>
      <p class="intro">We have created a list of Questions that you may have. Just go through it, and if you have any other doubts you can always ask in the group! </p>
      <div align="center">
      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>  1) I have to take a loan but we have to initially pay the acceptance fee, <br> this fee can be reimbursed later?</strong></p> 
      <p>  You can apply for the loan. As loan approval may take time, you have to pay the first semester <br> fee on your own. Later these amount can be reimbursed, once your loan is approved.</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>  2) What documents will be required at the time of admission.</strong></p>
      <p>  Transfer Certificate (TC) and Migration Certificate will be required. Even if you don't have right now, you can submit that later also. <br>(But it's always good to mail the academic office, if you have any issues)</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>  3)What's the difference between CS and CS-IS?</strong></p>
      <p>   First of all there is no as such difference in terms of placements. All students can sit for the companies.<br>
        The course structure varies a little,<br>
        For CS-IS:<br>
        1st Sem: Same as CSE.<br>
        (Bus abhi first sem par hi focus karo...)<br>
        (chalo but ek overview de dete hai..)<br>
        2nd Sem: 2 course is fixed (POIS (a bouquet course) and SNS - Which are easy subjects and hence 80 % of the class ends up taking that) + two subjects of your choice. <br> 
        3rd Sem: 2 Courses fixed (Advanced computer network (bouquet course) and one more) + rest depends on your choice.<br>
        4th Sem: You get the opportunity (easily as compared to CSE) to get a 8 credit project + 1 fixed subject + 1 of your choice.
        <br>
        Note: Except first sem, for both CSE and CS-IS , all the subjects are of 4 credits each! 
    </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>4) One must have good coding skills to survive at IIIT H? </strong></p>
      <p>IIIT H is famous for it's coding environment. Here, in every coursework you require to code. So it's good to have some basic coding experience.</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>5) I haven't done coding at all or I am a complete beginner, how will i survive ?</strong></p>
      <p>Just don't worry about it. This is the case for many students, so you are not alone. Just keep brushing your coding skills, learn some basic stuff and you will be good. :)</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>6) Which language to choose for coding?</strong></p>
      <p>Strictly C++ for now. There will be coding assignments in first sem in which you have to code in C++.<br> It's good to have knowledge of Python and other languages. But here mostly coding will be in C++.</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>7) How to get started with coding?</strong></p>
      <p>Just go through the resources section at the bottom.</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>8) How to get internships?</strong></p>
      <p>Well, many students have this doubt. You have just got admission ..relax for now!! <br>
      Anyway, Internships are unofficial here at IIIT H, There is a seperate body called SPC (Student Placement Committe) which will let you know all the stuff regarding Internships! </p>  

      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>9) What is the grading procedure at IIIT H?</strong></p>
      <p>Grading will be relative. Means Professor will determine student grades by comparing them against those of your peers.<br> There will not be any absolute grading rather your marks will fluctuate depending on how you did as compared to others in class.<br>In short, if all students suck at a particular assignment then you are good, but if many did exceptionally well <br>and you didn't then the average score will increase and your grade will be affected greatly!</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>10) Everyone gets GATE Stipend?</strong></p>
      <p> In our batch all students got the GATE Stipend. But this depends on the institute, i think you all will get too, Let's see! 
      <br>The stipend is of Rs. 12,400 for 22 months. </p>

      <h2>Resources.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
      <p>Here's a list of resources that will be helpful for you to get start with coding. 
      (If you have any other resources just follow them and practice as much as you can, it will help you later in your coding assignments!) </p>


      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <p>1.To get comfortable with the coding contests get familiar with STLs first:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfBJlB6T2eOvyt21CIX_PMmhOgWHiFVab" target="_blank">C++ STLs</a></p>
        <p>To make sure everyone is on the same page and avoid confusion:<br>
2. To get command on C++ : <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=cpp" target="_blank">CPP Practice</a>

<br>
3. To practice data structure and algorithm: <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit" target="_blank">Data Structures and Algo Practice</a>
<br>
4. While using hackerrank, focus on easy and medium ones only.</p>

<p><strong>For now just start coding.</strong><br>
1)Get familiar with C++ if you aren't already.<br>
2)Get comfortable with online platforms like hackerrank.<br>
3)Learn how input is taken and out is given on such platforms.<br>
4)Learn the basics of STL(Standard template library). Gfg is best for all such resources.<br>

It will be difficult at first, even the thought of it. But be assured that with time it will come handy.
Remember when it comes to competitive programming, practice is the key! 
Start as early as possible. It won't matter if you are pro at it already or total beginner. Just start as soon as possible.</p>
